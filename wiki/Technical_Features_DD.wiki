This document should contain list of important technical features. Especially those which would be harder to implement later. It might be also pointed out which significant technical features of modern video games won't be implemented.

= Details =

===Should be implemented:===
  * Platform independence (via SDL)
  * Own model/object format
    * Keyframe animations
    * Vertices/Normals/TexCoords
      * Preferably pre-order for VBO
    * Name(s) of material script(s)
  * Material scripts
    * Textures/shaders
  * Cg Shader support

===Does not need to be implemented:===
  * *Networking*
  * Any sophisticated "shadowing" algorithm
  * Any sophisticated physics engine
